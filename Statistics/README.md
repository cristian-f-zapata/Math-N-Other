### statistics

This folder contains the exercises and assignments that I solved using Python for the statistics course at UQ, based on the book by Walpole:

- `chi squared.ipynb`: A notebook that has exercises on the chi-squared distribution and test.
- `Dist_Beta_n_Weib.ipynb`: A notebook that has exercises on the beta and Weibull distributions.
- `Dist_Exp_n_Gamma.ipynb`: A notebook that has exercises on the exponential and gamma distributions.
- `Dist_Hygeo_n_Geo_n_BinN.ipynb`: A notebook that has exercises on the hypergeometric, geometric, and negative binomial distributions.
- `Dist_Norm.ipynb`: A notebook that has exercises on the normal distribution and the central limit theorem.
- `Dist_Poi.ipynb`: A notebook that has exercises on the Poisson distribution and the Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution.
- `Exam_3.ipynb`: A notebook that has the solutions to the third partial exam.
- `Hyptest1.ipynb`: A notebook that has exercises on hypothesis testing for one and two samples.
- `Hyptest2.ipynb`: A notebook that has exercises on hypothesis testing for proportions, variances, and correlations.
- `Multi_LinReg.ipynb`: A notebook that has the final project using multiple linear regression.

# math-n-others

This repository contains some of the work I did at UQ using numerical methods, Python, and statistics.

## Contents

The repository has three main folders: numeric methold, python, and statistics.

### numeric methold

This folder contains three subfolders with the assignments for each term:

Corte 1: This subfolder has the following files:

- `Bisection.py`: A script that implements the bisection method for finding roots.
- `false position.py`: A script that implements the false position method for finding roots.
- `Fixed point iteration.py`: A script that implements the fixed point iteration method for finding roots.
- `Millikan lab.py`: A script that uses experimental data and numerical methods to estimate the charge of the electron in the Millikan oil drop experiment.
- `Newton-Rapson multiple roots.py`: A script that implements the Newton-Raphson method for finding multiple roots.
- `secant method.py`: A script that implements the secant method for finding roots.
- `Standard Newton-Rapson.py`: A script that implements the standard Newton-Raphson method for finding roots.

Corte 2: This subfolder has the following files:

- `Lagrange interpolation.py`: A script that implements the Lagrange interpolation method for finding the polynomial that passes through a given set of points.
- `Muller method.py`: A script that implements the Muller method for finding complex roots.
- `Newton divided differences.py`: A script that implements the Newton divided differences method for finding the coefficients of the interpolating polynomial.
- `Splines 3.py`: A script that implements the cubic spline method for finding a piecewise polynomial that passes through a given set of points.
- `Trapezoid Integration.py`: A script that implements the trapezoid rule for approximating the integral of a function.

Corte 3: This subfolder has the following files:

- `Euler Method.py`: A script that implements the Euler method for solving ordinary differential equations.
- `N-Methods Calculator.py`: A script that is a calculator that has several numerical methods implemented.
- `Romberg Methold.py`: A script that implements the Romberg method for improving the accuracy of the trapezoid rule.
- `Simpson 1/3 Methold.py`: A script that implements the Simpson's 1/3 rule for approximating the integral of a function.

### Basic_Python_Exercises

This folder contains two files, which have 31 exercises to improve the logic of programming:

- `python_exercises_1.ipynb`: A notebook that has 20 exercises, such as finding the factorial of a number, reversing a string, and checking if a number is prime.
- `python_exercises_2.ipynb`: A notebook that has 11 exercises, such as creating a matrix calculator, solving systems of the form AX=B, and finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

### statistics

This folder contains the exercises and assignments that I solved using Python for the statistics course at UQ, based on the book by Walpole:

- `chi squared.ipynb`: A notebook that has exercises on the chi-squared distribution and test.
- `Dist_Beta_n_Weib.ipynb`: A notebook that has exercises on the beta and Weibull distributions.
- `Dist_Exp_n_Gamma.ipynb`: A notebook that has exercises on the exponential and gamma distributions.
- `Dist_Hygeo_n_Geo_n_BinN.ipynb`: A notebook that has exercises on the hypergeometric, geometric, and negative binomial distributions.
- `Dist_Norm.ipynb`: A notebook that has exercises on the normal distribution and the central limit theorem.
- `Dist_Poi.ipynb`: A notebook that has exercises on the Poisson distribution and the Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution.
- `Exam_3.ipynb`: A notebook that has the solutions to the third partial exam.
- `Hyptest1.ipynb`: A notebook that has exercises on hypothesis testing for one and two samples.
- `Hyptest2.ipynb`: A notebook that has exercises on hypothesis testing for proportions, variances, and correlations.
- `Multi_LinReg.ipynb`: A notebook that has the final project using multiple linear regression.
